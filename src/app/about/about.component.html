        The chemical diversity and known safety profiles of drugs already tested in humans makes them a valuable set of compounds to explore potential therapeutic utility in indications outside those originally targeted. This practice of “drug
        repurposing” has
        become commonplace in academic and other non-profit drug discovery efforts, with the appeal that significantly less time and resources are required to advance a candidate into the clinic. This is especially the case in phenotypic and other
        cell-based
        screens in which this collection is being screened against a large number of known and novel targets in parallel.

        Here we report a comprehensive open-access, drug repositioning screening set of 12,000 compounds (termed ReFRAME) that was assembled by combining three widely-used commercial drug competitive intelligence databases (Clarivate Integrity, GVK
        Excelra GoStar
        and Citeline Pharmaprojects), together with extensive patent mining of small molecules that have been dosed in humans. To date ~12,000 compounds (~80% of compounds identified from data mining) have been purchased or synthesized, and
        subsequently
        plated for screening.
